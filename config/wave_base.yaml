# Configuration for CSDI Wave Height Imputation and Prediction
# Based on the official CSDI base.yaml with adaptations for wave data

train:
  epochs: 200
  batch_size: 16
  lr: 1.0e-3
  itr_per_epoch: 1.0e+8  # Use all available batches per epoch

diffusion:
  layers: 4
  channels: 64
  nheads: 8
  diffusion_embedding_dim: 128
  beta_start: 0.0001
  beta_end: 0.5
  num_steps: 50
  schedule: "quad"  # quadratic schedule
  is_linear: False  # Use transformer (not linear) attention

model:
  is_unconditional: 0  # Conditional model (use observed data as condition)
  timeemb: 128  # Time embedding dimension
  featureemb: 16  # Feature embedding dimension
  target_strategy: "mix"  # mix of random and historical masking
  # For NDBC1: use "mix" or "historical" due to block missing patterns
  # For NDBC2: can use "random" for simpler random missing
  num_sample_features: 9  # Number of features (not used for wave, but kept for compatibility)
